# matrix-factorization


## Goal

Understand matrix factorization and singular value decomposition (SVD), and how this can be used to create a recommender system. Also, understand why this approach could be better than using the user-based or item-based collaborative filtering. 

## Matrix Factorization 101

1. Factorize a matrix to find out two matrices such that when you multiply them, you will get back the original matrix.
2. Use to discover latent features underlying the interactions between two different kinds of entities.
3. Use to predict ratings (sparse values, or zeros `0` in matrices). Most of the time, the matrix will be sparse because not all users will rate an item. With matrix factorization, we can _predict_ the rating that the user will give on items they have not rated yet.

1. Run it parallel
2. Hashing the string and store it instead of the whole object (?)
